        Iâ€™m a software designer passionate about building sleek, functional, and
        retro-inspired apps. My toolkit includes modern frameworks like Deno
        Fresh, React, and Python â€” but Iâ€™m just as excited about experimenting
        with game design, simulations, and UI/UX aesthetics.
